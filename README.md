# Modelling-and-Observational-Data-Project

In this project, we aimed to investigate the relationship between various characteristics of Alzheimer's disease and the diagnosis of Alzheimer's (Demented) or not (Nondemented). Using R programming language, the provided dataset (project data.csv) was analyzed through descriptive statistics, clustering algorithms, logistic regression modeling, and feature selection methods. The findings contribute to understanding Alzheimer's disease and have implications for early detection and management.
